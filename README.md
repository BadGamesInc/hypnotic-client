## How to upload a custom cape  
Open the jar file with a program like 7zip (or winrar) and go to assets/minecraft/hypnotic/textures/capes/
and replace cape.png with a cape file of your choice (make sure it has the same name) or alternatively
do it like a texture pack and just make a new directory in the assests folder called hypnotic/textures/capes
and add the cape.png

## Disclaimer
if you hate skidded clients then this is not the client for you,
this client is just something for me (BadGamesInc) to learn coding and learn about java
so i can make my own stuff, im not going to claim that the client is entirely original, a good bit of the stuff is original but a good bit is also skidded
