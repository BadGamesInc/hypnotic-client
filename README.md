# HYPNOTIC CLINET  
## gaming awards frame winner 1999/2000/2001  
"utility mod" for minecraft java 1.8.8  
we dont care if you get banned from any server  
use at your own risk i guess  

## requirements  
you need to import the io.netty files and pack.png from a stock jar and put the files from this jar ( https://github.com/Vatuu/discord-rpc/releases/download/1.6.2/discord-rpc.jar )in it 
if you are exporting the client from a development environment
  
## authors  
BadGamesInc - actual knowledge  
KawaiiZenbo - made the logo and ported badclient modules (still has to keep editing the readme)  
Whoever else we stole code from  
## how to upload a custom cape
Open the jar file with a program like 7zip (or winrar) and go to assets/minecraft/hypnotic/textures/capes/
and replace cape.png with a cape file of your choice (make sure it has the same name)
## how to import into eclipse
download the hypnotic source and mcp 918 from https://modcoderpack.com and extract all the mcp files
to a new folder and run decompile.bat. Once it has finished go into the src file in the directory
you ran decompile.bat and delete the minecraft folder and replace it with the minecraft folder from
the hypnotic source zip. Once you have done all that run eclipse and make a new workspace, the 
directory should be the eclipse folder in your project folder. Wait for it to build and if you get any
errors right click on the Client folder, click buildpath>configure-buildpath and the go to the libraries tab
and double click on jre 1.6 and change the compliance to 1.8. Now it should work when you go to debug it.
I probably explained that in the worst way possible but its good enough

## disclaimer
if you hate skidded clients then this is not the client for you,
this client is just something for me (BadGamesInc) to learn coding and learn about java
so i can make my own stuff, im not going to claim that the client is entirely original, a good bit of the stuff is original but a good bit is also skidded
