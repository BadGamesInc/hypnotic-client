## requirements  
you need to import the io.netty files and pack.png from a stock jar and put the files from this jar (https://github.com/Vatuu/discord-rpc/releases/download/1.6.2/discord-rpc.jar)in it 
if you are exporting the client from a development environment
  
## authors  
BadGamesInc - actual knowledge  
KawaiiZenbo - knows next to nothing, has to keep editing the readme  
Whoever else we stole code from  
## how to upload a custom cape
Open the jar file with a program like 7zip (or winrar) and go to assets/minecraft/hypnotic/textures/capes/
and replace cape.png with a cape file of your choice (make sure it has the same name)
## how to import into eclipse
download the hypnotic source and mcp 918 from https://modcoderpack.com and extract all the mcp files
to a new folder and run decompile.bat. Once it has finished go into the src file in the directory
you ran decompile.bat and delete the minecraft folder and replace it with the minecraft folder from
the hypnotic source zip. Once you have done all that run eclipse and make a new workspace, the 
directory should be the eclipse folder in your project folder. Wait for it to build and if you get any
errors right click on the Client folder, click buildpath>configure-buildpath and the go to the libraries tab
and double click on jre 1.6 and change the compliance to 1.8. Now it should work when you go to debug it.
I probably explained that in the worst way possible but its good enough
